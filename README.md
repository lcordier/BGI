# AGI vs. BGI

Hi, I have spotted some minor issues with the current route to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).  I have made a breakthrough with Biological General Intelligence (BGI) thou. Training takes a lot longer, but the results are far more impressive.

> Psychosis is when people lose some contact with reality. This might involve seeing or hearing things that other people cannot see or hear (hallucinations) and believing things that are not actually true (delusions).

We have already seen LLM exhibit hallucinations. Being trained on human data it follows it will suffer from delusions as well.

In BGI this issue was addressed with:

Does anybody know if it is in the books3 dataset?

My BGI dataset is 851G big, prolly too big for GitHub, I don't have a dedicated box to host a torrent and I am not sure how to get it on Hugging Face. Someone please help me [@lcordier_x](https://twitter.com/lcordier_x/)

Anyway the dataset contains copyrighted material. I didn't steal it, I just borrowed it. Think deferred payment. Since data is the new gold, I am turning your copyrighted works into [Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)](https://www.investopedia.com/non-fungible-tokens-nft-5115211). Well each copyright holder will have to do the blockchain thing themselves. Weâ€™re square?

By releasing this dataset metadata I am effectively recommending your copyrighted work and this counts as advertising (included in my deferred payment).

You can see the metadata in the file:
[training_metadata.txt.bz2](https://github.com/lcordier/BGI/raw/main/training_metadata.txt.bz2)

Oh yeah, the foundational paper for BGI is:

PS. I will obviously first sanitize this dataset (remove questionable content) and allow for copyright holders to remove their files if they so wish before making it public.
